A web-based text transformation tool built with **PHP** and **Bootstrap**, designed to perform various string operations through an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Replace words or phrases
- ✅ Reverse or shuffle characters
- ✅ Compare strings and extract substrings
- ✅ Split or join text (explode/implode)

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **PHP** – for server-side processing and string manipulation

- **JavaScript** – to dynamically manage input fields


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters text and selects a string operation from the dropdown.
2. Based on the selected operation, any necessary input fields are displayed.
3. On form submission, PHP handles the selected function and returns the result.
4. Results are displayed on the same page.
